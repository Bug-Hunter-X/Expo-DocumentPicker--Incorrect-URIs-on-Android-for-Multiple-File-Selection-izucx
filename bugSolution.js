This solution attempts to address the truncated URI issue.  It is important to note this is a workaround.  The best solution is to wait for Expo to fix the core issue. This solution tries to reconstruct full paths using available information (this might require platform-specific adjustments). It is highly recommended to check for null or undefined before trying to use the result.

```javascript
import * as DocumentPicker from 'expo-document-picker';

async function pickMultipleFiles() {
  try {
    const result = await DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync({
      multiple: true,
    });
    console.log('Original URIs:', result.uris);
    const correctedUris = result.uris.map(uri => {
      // Attempt to correct URIs. This is highly platform and implementation specific and may need adjustments based on your project setup.
      const fixedUri = uri.startsWith('content://') ? uri : `content://${uri}`; // Example correction. Adapt as needed
      return fixedUri; // Return corrected or original if correction wasn't possible
    });
    console.log('Corrected URIs:', correctedUris);
    // Attempt to access files using correctedUris
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('Error picking files:', e);
  }
}
```
